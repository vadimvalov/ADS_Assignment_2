## Homework for Algorithms and Data Structure course. MyArrayList and MyLinkedList creation without Arraylists and LinkedLists

<h4> MyList interface contains: </h4>

int size();
boolean contains(Object o);
void add(T item);
void add(T item, int index);
boolean remove(T item);
T remove(T item);
void clear();
T get(int index);
int indexOf(Object o);
int lastIndexOf(Object o);
void sort();

<h5> MyArrayList and MyLinkedList are overriding those methods. </h5>

'MyArrayList': A list implementation that uses an array to store elements.
'MyLinkedList': A list implementation that uses a linked list to store elements.

<h4> Testing: </h4>
To ensure the correctness, 'test.java' file is open to edit. Simply create a class and call it's methods. 

<h4> Contributing: </h4>
This is a homework assignment and I do not plan to develop this project further. However, I will certainly review Pull Requests. Obviously, I have lots of mistakes over here, so you can fix them :)
